Neural Network Classifier for Shapes Recognition




This is a simple neural network classifier implemented in Python using the NumPy library. The goal of this project is to recognize different shapes (ellipses, triangles, and circles) from images and classify them accordingly.





Features

a. Multi-layer neural network architecture.
b. Sigmoid activation function for hidden and output layers.
c. Backpropagation for training the network.
d. Shape recognition using image convolution and feature extraction.
e. Ability to adjust the number of hidden layers during training.
